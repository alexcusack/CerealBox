<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SETI</span>&#x2014;<span class="s1">the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</span>&#x2014;<span class="s1">has been one of the most captivating areas of science since its inception in 1960, when the astronomer Frank Drake used an 85-foot radio telescope in the first-ever attempt to detect interstellar radio transmissions sent by&#xA0;beings outside our solar system. Yet despite its high public visibility and near-ubiquity in blockbuster Hollywood science fiction, throughout most of its 55-year history SETI has languished on the fringes of scientific research, garnering relatively scant funding and only small amounts of dedicated observation time on world-class telescopes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, in a live webcast </span>originating from London and&#xA0;<span class="s1">set for 6:30 am Eastern, the Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, along&#xA0;</span>with the physicist Stephen Hawking,&#xA0;<span class="s1">is announcing his intentions to change that. Watch the live streamed event below, starting at 6:30 am.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although Milner has made his name</span>&#x2014;<span class="s1">and billions of dollars</span>&#x2014;<span class="s1">through investments in Facebook, Alibaba, and many other tech start-ups, his true passion is science, which he has demonstrated through his formation of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation. This organization&#xA0;awards the world's most lavish scientific prizes. Milner's latest project is part of the Foundation's new Breakthrough Initiatives division and is called Breakthrough Listen. Providing $100 million in funding over the next decade to top SETI researchers, Breakthrough Listen will allow new state-of-the-art radio and optical surveys to take place using the world's premiere telescopes, creating the most ambitious and robust SETI program yet performed. The project is set&#xA0;to begin making observations in 2016.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following the live webcast, Milner and distinguished scientists participating in Breakthrough Listen will conduct a media teleconference to discuss the new project and answer questions. <em>Scientific American</em> will continue to follow this story as it develops.</span></p>
